I created this repo to hold code for a Test Automation error handling utility that utilizes AI both in creating it and to perform the analysis.  
This was created for a java-selenium stack

THIS CODE IS NOT TESTED NOR IS IT RELEASE-READY

This is a personal sandbox for me to learn to use AI to develop applications.  I envision this being done in three phases, which I'll document somewhere.  
I had Claude "build" the first two plus some refinements.  As of 2/18/2026 I have not manually reviewed the code and made changes to it, so again if you found this
it is a sandbox for me to learn the nuance of AI generated code.
