I created this repo to hold code for a Test Automation error handling utility that utilizes AI both in creating it and to perform the analysis.  
This was created for a java-selenium stack and is intended to be compiled as a library for projects to call, but for now will be tested as if it were part of a real project.

THIS CODE IS UNDER TEST! I am trying to only have Claude make changes with me updating prompts and asking questions.
THERE ARE HALLUNICATIONS in this that I am trying to find and have Claude fix.  Usually I would fix myself but I am trying to have an AI genrated app.

This is a personal sandbox for me to learn to use AI to develop applications.  I envision this being done in three phases, which I'll document somewhere.  
I had Claude "build" the first two plus some refinements.  

As of Feb 20th, I have tests working that will pull from a local repository of known conditions.  Next steps are to show 
the details and turn those into local actions within the test framework to take corrective action.
